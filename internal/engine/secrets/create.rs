	/// `podup.project=<proj>` so it can be cleaned up on `down`. The payload size
	/// is checked up front to turn Podman's opaque 500 into a clear message.
	///
	/// Idempotent across re-`up`s: rather than `replace=true` (which some Podman
	/// 5.x builds reject when the secret does not yet exist: the internal delete
	/// fails with "no secret data with ID"), the existing secret of this name is
	/// removed first (a 404 is fine) and then created fresh.
	///
	/// # Concurrency contract: read before touching the inspect → delete → create sequence
	///
	/// The inspect-then-delete-then-create is **not** atomic at the libpod wire
	/// level, so a race in the window could delete something the caller does
	/// not own or land a state inconsistent with what the inspect claimed. Two
	/// guards close the cases that matter in practice:
	///
	/// 1. The **cross-invocation** case is closed by the per-project lock
	///    ([`crate::engine::lock`]) held for the duration of `up`. Two
	///    `podup` processes touching the same project serialise through it,
	///    so the inspect is never stale across processes.
	/// 2. The **within-invocation** case is closed by the project-scoped
	///    naming. Every secret created here has a name of the form
	///    `<project>_...`, which is unique to this `Engine` instance, and the
	///    inspect rejects any name that does not carry `podup.project=<proj>`
	///    so a foreign secret of the same literal name is refused rather
	///    than clobbered. A race with the same project therefore cannot
	///    happen in the same process.
	///
	/// What these two guards do **not** cover: an external actor (a manual
	/// `podman secret create`, a separate compose stack, a test harness) that
	/// claims a project-scoped name in the window between inspect and create.
	/// That falls through to a `500 from libpod`, which this function
	/// recognises and rewraps into a legible "something else created a secret
	/// of that name in between" message, so the operator can act on it without
	/// having to read the libpod error verbatim.
