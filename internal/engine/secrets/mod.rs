//! Secret and config injection.
//!
//! Every source is injected as a Podman-native secret attached to the container
//! create spec:
//!
//! * inline `content:`/`environment:` and `file:` → created over the libpod API
//!   (`secrets/create`, removing any prior secret of the name first so a re-`up`
//!   is idempotent) under a project-scoped name, so nothing is written to a host
//!   staging directory. The project's whole payload union is created once up
//!   front by [`Engine::create_project_secrets`] (before services start
//!   concurrently), not per-service, so a shared name is never raced.
//! * `external: true` → mapped to a pre-existing `podman secret`, preflighted
//!   with [`Engine::ensure_external_exists`] so a missing secret fails closed.
//!
//! `file:` sources used to be read-only bind mounts of the host path instead.
//! That worked until the host enforced SELinux, where the container is denied
//! the read outright and `up` still reports the container as started, measured
//! on Fedora with both supported Podman majors, and reproduced by plain `podman
//! run`, so the denial was the missing relabel and not podup. Relabelling was
//! the other way out, but `z` rewrites the label of a file the user owns and may
//! share with a confined host service, and compose gives them nowhere to ask for
//! it. Reading the bytes into a native secret leaves the host untouched and puts
//! `file:` on the path the other two sources already took. What the container
//! sees is unchanged: the mount mode mirrors the host file's own bits (see
//! [`plan::host_file_secret_mode`]) rather than defaulting to `0444`.
//!
//! The trade is that the payload is a copy taken at `up`, so an in-place edit of
//! the host file no longer reaches a running container. An atomic replace never
//! did: a file bind pins the inode, so the write-new-and-rename that every
//! careful rotation tool performs was already invisible.
//!
//! The pure compose→plan mapping lives in [`plan`].
