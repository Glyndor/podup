//! The bidirectional terminal loop, shared by interactive `exec` and `run`.
//!
//! Both hand a hijacked socket to the caller's terminal and pump bytes until the
//! command ends. They differ only in which libpod object gets resized — an exec
//! session or a container — so that is the one parameter, and the loop that must
//! not get raw mode wrong lives once rather than twice.
