//! Test-only fake Podman socket.
//!
//! A minimal libpod HTTP responder bound to a Unix domain socket, so
//! lifecycle/scale/query tests can assert exit-code semantics against canned
//! API responses without a real Podman daemon. [`Client`] opens a fresh
//! connection per request (see `internal/libpod/client/mod.rs`), so this only
//! ever needs to answer one HTTP/1.1 request per accepted connection, with no
//! keep-alive.
//!
//! It does frame a chunked body, for one reason: a stream that ends *badly* has
//! a wire shape, and podup's central open question about streaming (#1104) is
//! whether it can tell that shape from a stream that ended well. A real Podman
//! cannot be asked to break a stream on demand, and which shape it produces at a
//! CLEAN end turns out to differ by version, so the two cases are pinned here,
//! deterministically, with no daemon and no version in the picture.
