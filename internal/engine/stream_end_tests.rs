//! What a streaming read looks like when it ends well, and when it does not.
//!
//! #1104 is the question of whether podup can tell those apart. The argument has
//! been circular so far because the only evidence came from a live daemon, where
//! *both* the version and the wire shape move at once: making a mid-stream error
//! fatal reddened fifteen tests on the lane's Podman 5.8.1 while the identical
//! commit stayed green on 5.4.2.
//!
//! These tests take the daemon out of it. The fake writes the wire shapes
//! deliberately, so what podup does with each is pinned here rather than inferred
//! from a lane run.
//!
//! Two things they settle:
//!
//! 1. **podup's parsing is not the ambiguity.** A properly terminated chunked body
//!    reaches the caller as a clean end, every time. So when a *finished* stream
//!    arrives as an error on some Podman version, the framing came that way: no
//!    predicate on `hyper::Error` can invent a difference the server did not send.
//!    That is the case for the out-of-band re-check `logs` and `stats` already use,
//!    and for `events` needing one of its own.
//! 2. **A severed stream is not `IncompleteMessage`.** That predicate is about the
//!    message head. Both places a cut can land in a body arrive as a hyper Body
//!    error wrapping `io::ErrorKind::UnexpectedEof`, which used to fall through to
//!    `hyper-other`. Anything keyed on the `IncompleteMessage` text, including the
//!    lane's own flake counter, cannot see them.
