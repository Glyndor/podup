/// How an attached `up` stopped streaming.

/// The distinction has to survive back to the caller because the four endings
/// mean different things to a script: the containers finishing on their own is
/// success, the operator pressing Ctrl-C is not, a stream that died under a
/// container still running is a failed read, and an abort triggered by a
/// container exit carries the exit code the caller wants to propagate. The
/// caller still tears the project down in every case except the abort, where
/// `attach` itself already stopped every remaining container. Reporting an
/// ending as an error from `attach` would short-circuit that and leave the
/// containers running, which is a worse bug than the exit code this exists to
/// fix.
///
/// When the outcome is `Aborted`, the service name and exit code travel back
/// alongside it in [`AttachSummary`], not as fields of the variant: keeping the
/// enum all-unit preserves the `Copy` derive this enum had before
/// `--abort-on-container-exit` (#1492) and keeps the defined discriminants
