//! Interactive `exec`: a pseudo-terminal and a live stdin.
//!
//! `podup exec -it db psql` is the most-used shell-into-a-container habit in
//! compose, and it did not work: podup allocated no TTY and attached no stdin,
//! so `-i` set a flag nothing read and `-T` disabled something that never
//! existed (#1079). Unix shipped first; Windows followed once the hijack ran
//! over the named pipe and raw mode spoke the console API (#1154). The
//! non-interactive path is unchanged everywhere, so `podup exec` in a script
//! behaves exactly as before on every platform.
