/// every child, so the two cannot disagree about what ends up in the
/// result. In practice the call site mirrors the existing
/// `is_ignored` check: if the directory is in a pattern, the contents
/// are too, with the negation edge case left for
/// the call site to handle (the engine currently has no negation
/// patterns in the wild that would re-include a child of an ignored
/// directory; if one is added the fix is to return `false` here for
