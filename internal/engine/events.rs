	///   any ending means the stream was lost. Returns
	///   [`ComposeError::StreamTruncated`](crate::ComposeError::StreamTruncated).
	///
	/// Also returns `Err` if a `--filter` is malformed or the stream cannot be
	/// opened.
	///
	/// A window needs **both** ends to close, and both must already have
	/// elapsed. Measured against Podman 5.4.2: `since` and `until` together
	/// close the feed, whether absolute or relative (a past relative window is
	/// `--since 2h --until -1h`; re-measured on 5.7.0 with `since=30s&until=-1s`); either one
	/// alone leaves it open, as does any `until` in the future. So `--until 5m`
