/// What `up` knows about a container the project already has, read once from
/// the container list before any work starts.
///
/// Two facts decide whether the container is left alone or replaced, and they
/// answer different questions. The config hash says whether the compose
/// definition changed. The image ID says whether the image the container is
/// bound to is still the one its service resolves to, which the hash cannot:
/// a rebuild, a `pull`, or a `podman tag` moves the name and leaves the hash
/// untouched. docker compose recreates on either (measured on v5.3.1: an
/// unchanged `build:` service stays `Running`; retagging its image, or
/// rebuilding it out of band, gets `Recreate`). Before #1620 podup approximated
/// the second question with "does the service have a `build:` key", which
/// recreated every build service on every `up` and never noticed a retagged
/// `image:` one.

	/// project's container list so the scale-reconciliation step in `run_up`

/// What one service's image tag resolves to, asked at most once for all of that

/// request and the others read its answer. Twenty-one replicas of one image
/// used to be twenty-one identical inspects (#1759).
///
/// Lifetime: created after this service's own image acquisition has finished,
/// so it does not span this service's pull or build, and dropped with this
/// service's replica loop, so it does not span another `up` invocation (each
/// call to `up_one_service` makes a fresh one). It is not shared between
/// services.
///
/// Services within one dependency level start concurrently, so the cell CAN
/// overlap a sibling service in the same level that pulls or builds the same
/// tag while this service's replicas are running. When that happens either
/// all of this service's replicas see the move or none do, and the next `up`
/// catches it. Before the change a move that landed during the loop was
/// already missed by every replica that had inspected before it, and that
/// mixed-answer behaviour is what is being narrowed here (#1759).
///
/// A pull or a build of the tag is exactly what moves it, and an answer that
/// outlived the replica loop would make `up` stop noticing a moved tag. That
/// was tried with the ID the prefetch stage had fetched, and the two live
/// retag tests (`recreate_on_image`, `x_podman_autoupdate`) refused it.
///
/// Only an answer is kept. A failed inspect fails the replica that made it, as
/// it always did, and the next replica asks again.
