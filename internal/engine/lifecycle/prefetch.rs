//! Best-effort image prefetch ahead of the per-level `up` walk.
//!
//! Without this stage each service's image is pulled inside `up_one_service`,
//! gated behind the dependency-level barrier: on a cold start, a level-2
//! service's image acquisition does not even begin until every level-1 service
//! is fully up. This stage collects every image the upcoming `up`/`create` pass will
//! pull and warms the local Podman cache for all of them up front,
//! concurrently, before the first level barrier, instead of one at a time as
//! each level's services reach their turn.
//!
//! Best-effort only for prefetch *misses*: an unreachable socket or a registry
//! that 500s is logged at debug and otherwise swallowed. `up_one_service`'s
//! own pull call is unchanged and remains the sole source of a real pull
//! failure: this stage can only make `up` faster, never change whether it
//! succeeds.
//!
//! An invalid `pull_policy:` (or `--pull`) is **not** a prefetch miss. It is
//! a configuration error and propagates here as `Err`, before a single pull
//! is dispatched, so the operator sees it instead of a silent wrong image
//! (#1443).

	/// uses. Returns `Err` for an unrecognized `pull_policy:` so a typo
	/// (`pull_policy: alaways`) is reported instead of being treated as
	/// `missing` (#1443); prefetch I/O errors stay debug-level and never
