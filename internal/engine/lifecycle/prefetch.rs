//! Best-effort image prefetch ahead of the per-level `up` walk.
//!
//! Today, each service's image is pulled inside `up_one_service`, gated
//! behind the dependency-level barrier: on a cold start, a level-2 service's
//! image acquisition does not even begin until every level-1 service is fully
//! up. This stage collects every image the upcoming `up`/`create` pass will
//! pull and warms the local Podman cache for all of them up front,
//! concurrently, before the first level barrier — instead of one at a time as
//! each level's services reach their turn.
//!
//! Best-effort only: a prefetch miss is logged at debug and otherwise
//! swallowed. `up_one_service`'s own pull call is unchanged and remains the
//! sole source of a real pull failure — this stage can only make `up` faster,
//! never change whether it succeeds.
