		// Measured cost of the barrier on a 41-service level with one dependent
		// behind one of them: the dependent started 809ms after its dependency
		// under barriers and 129ms under docker compose's per-service DAG,
		// because a level is created with bounded concurrency and the barrier
		// made the dependent wait for the last batch rather than for what it
		// actually needed.
		//
		// Two things make this safe to do with plain futures:
		//
		// * `try_join_all` polls *every* future, so a service blocked on a
		//   dependency yields and the others make progress. `buffer_unordered`
		//   would deadlock here — it only polls the first N, and those N can
		//   all be waiting on a dependency that is queued behind them.
		// * the concurrency bound is a semaphore held only across the actual
		//   work, never across a dependency wait, for the same reason.
		//
		// A failure cancels the rest: `try_join_all` drops the other futures on
		// the first error, so a service still waiting on a dependency that will
		// now never come up is dropped rather than hanging.
