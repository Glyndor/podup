//! Shared healthcheck readiness for the concurrent `up` path.
//!
//! When several services in a dependency level declare `depends_on: <svc>:
//! {condition: service_healthy}`, they start concurrently and would each poll
//! that container's healthcheck, and every poll *runs* the check inside the
//! container, so a service N others wait on gets its healthcheck executed ~N×
//! per interval for the whole startup. [`Engine::build_readiness_map`] memoizes
//! one poller per container so the check runs once per interval regardless of
//! how many depend on it.
