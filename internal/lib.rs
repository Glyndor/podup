//! `podup` — docker-compose → Podman translator library.

//! Provides parsing, variable substitution, topological ordering, and an

//! REST API over a Unix socket or Windows named pipe.

// `unsafe` is denied crate-wide; the few modules that need libc FFI opt back in
// locally with `#![allow(unsafe_code)]` and a soundness comment per block, so a
// new `unsafe` block elsewhere fails the build.
