//! `podup audit`: render hardening findings for every service in a parsed
//! compose file. The command is a read-only view; it never contacts Podman
//! and never changes what `up` does.
//!
//! Checks live as a flat list of pure functions over the parsed
//! [`podup::compose::types::Service`]. Each check returns the list of
//! [`Finding`]s it raised; [`audit_file`] walks the file and the
//! [`render_table`]/[`render_json`] functions translate the result into the
//! `--format table|json` output the CLI asked for. `audit --list-checks` does
//! not walk a compose file at all: it enumerates the same registry the audit
//! dispatches against, so an integrator diffing the listing between releases
//! learns about every check the run path can fire.
