	// (containers/podman#22197): a `Type=oneshot` unit that polls
	// `systemctl is-active network-online.target` until the system target comes
	// up, which is the one thing a user unit can actually wait on.
	//
	// Quadlet mode gets this for free. `man podman-systemd.unit`, under *Implicit
	// network dependencies*, says the generator adds `Wants=`/`After=` on the
	// same shim to every `.container` unit it converts, so the files
	// `autostart/quadlet.rs` emits pick it up at boot. Service mode writes the
	// final unit itself and inherits nothing, and the reason applies here with
	// more force rather than less: Quadlet's `ExecStart` starts a container,
	// ours runs `podup up`, and rootless pasta builds the container network at
	// start time.
	//
	// Measured 2026-08-30: the shim first ships in Podman 5.3.0, and podup's
	// floor is 5.0. On 5.0 through 5.2 systemd finds no such unit, drops the
	// `Wants=`/`After=` with `LoadState=not-found`, and starts this unit clean
	// with `Result=success` and nothing in the journal, which is the behaviour

	// specifier-level escape, resolved during the same specifier-expansion pass
	// that runs over every unit-file value before the value is otherwise
	// interpreted. That pass does not care whether the value is a directive
