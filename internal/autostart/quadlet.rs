//! `podup autostart --mode quadlet`: hand the whole stack to systemd as native
//! Podman Quadlet units under the rootless `~/.config/containers/systemd/`.
//!
//! Where service mode installs one unit that shells out to `podup up` at boot,
//! quadlet mode writes the same `.container`/`.build`/`.volume`/`.network` units
//! `generate quadlet` emits, so systemd owns boot, restart and dependency
//! ordering directly. The generated `.container` units already carry
//! `[Install] WantedBy=default.target`, so a `daemon-reload` wires them into boot
//! on its own — this module writes them, reloads, and starts them now; it never
//! `enable`s a generated unit (systemd does not enable generator output).
