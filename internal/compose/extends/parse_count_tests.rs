// Behaviour test for #1746 entry 3: `extends: {file:}` is re-read and
// re-parsed once per referencing service.
//
// Without the cache, twenty services each saying
// `extends: { service: base, file: common.yml }` read and parse
// `common.yml` twenty times. Each parse holds the YAML value tree
// (the bytes are capped at 16 MiB but the parsed tree is much larger)
// while the merge runs, so the concurrent twenty peak at 5.8 GB and
// the process aborts. The fix is cache + bound, not a parse-count limit, so a test that
// counts the parses is the right shape.
