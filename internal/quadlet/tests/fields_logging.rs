//! Log-rotation rendering tests for the Quadlet export.
//!
//! `internal/quadlet/tests/fields.rs` carries the rest of the field-mapping
//! coverage; the log-rotation tests are pulled out into this file because
//! `fields.rs` was already near the per-file line cap and these two tests
//! alone were enough to push it over (#1354).

/// A service with no `logging:` block gets the rotation default so the
/// generated quadlet units ship the same rotation policy that `up` would
/// apply at runtime (#1354). Without this, `generate quadlet` would emit a
/// unit that runs without rotation, diverging from `up` behaviour.
///
/// The cap is rendered as a byte count rather than `10m` since #1417 moved
/// it into libpod's typed `size` field; `podman run --log-opt
/// max-size=10485760` was measured to produce the same cap as `max-size=10m`
/// on Podman 5.7.0. `max-file` is deliberately absent: it was measured to be
/// dropped by both the API and the CLI, so emitting it promised a rotation
/// nothing performed.
///
/// Both the default rotation and the user options are routed through
/// `PodmanArgs=--log-opt=` rather than `LogOpt=`, because the latter is a
/// Podman 5.2.0 addition and the supported floor is 5.0.
