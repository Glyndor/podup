/// This is deliberately separate from the `Label=podup.project=<project>`
/// line each unit also carries (kept for runtime scoping — Podman uses it for
/// container/secret lookups). A compose service's user-supplied `labels:` are
/// rendered into the same section as that `Label=` line, in the same
/// `Key=Value` shape, so a service declaring `labels: {podup.project: other}`
/// produces an indistinguishable forged `Label=podup.project=other` line
/// ahead of the real one. A `#`-prefixed line cannot be forged the same way:
/// compose labels only ever become `Label=key=value` entries, never a
/// comment, so this marker is the line ownership checks (`unit_owner` in
/// `crate::autostart::quadlet`) must read instead.

/// project lives. Any path a generated unit carries must therefore be made
/// absolute here, or it silently resolves somewhere else once installed.

/// An already-absolute path is returned untouched, and `.` means the base
