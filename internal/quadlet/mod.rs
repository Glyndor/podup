//! Translate a parsed compose file into Podman Quadlet unit files.
//!
//! Quadlet is Podman's systemd integration: declarative `.container`,
//! `.network` and `.volume` units placed under
//! `~/.config/containers/systemd/` that a systemd generator turns into
//! services, so systemd owns the lifecycle (boot, restart, dependencies)
//! instead of a long-running `podup` process.
//!
//! This is an additive export path, not a replacement for the runner. It
//! maps the common compose fields and warns, loudly and never silently, for
//! every field that is set but has no Quadlet equivalent yet, so generated
//! units never quietly drop configuration.
