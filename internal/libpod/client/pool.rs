//! Per-socket HTTP/1.1 connection pool for the libpod client.
//!
//! [`Client`](super::Client) opens and reuses hyper HTTP/1.1 connections to the
//! Podman socket (or named pipe on Windows) instead of a fresh connection per
//! request. A 100-service `up` would otherwise pay the per-request connect +
//! handshake cost ~600 times; the pool collapses that to one handshake per
//! concurrent caller.
//!
//! The pool is keyed by socket path, so a [`Client`](super::Client) holds one
//! pool and one pool is never shared across sockets. Two flavours of connection
//! are kept side by side:
//!
//! - **Buffered connections** are pooled. Every buffered call acquires one,
//!   uses it, and releases it on completion. A connection that observed an
//!   error is *poisoned* and dropped instead of returned to the idle queue, so
//!   the next acquire opens a fresh one.
//! - **Streaming connections** are dedicated to a single stream and held for
//!   the lifetime of that stream's body. They do not enter the buffered pool:
//!   a stream may be long-lived (`logs -f`, an interactive `exec`), and
//!   surrendering its socket to a buffered caller mid-stream would corrupt the
//!   wire. The [`Client`](super::Client) tracks its in-flight streaming
//!   connections and closes them when it is dropped.
