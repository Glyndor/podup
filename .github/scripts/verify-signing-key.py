"""Prove a freshly signed artifact verifies against the keys consumers embed.

Usage:
  verify-signing-key.py <signed-file> [<sig-file>]

sign.py checks only that GLYNDOR_RELEASE_ED25519_KEY is base64 that decodes to
32 bytes. A well-formed but WRONG seed therefore signs happily, and the release
publishes with a signature no installer, updater or apt client can verify — a
dead release, and releases are immutable, so the version is burnt and the fix is
a whole new one. The 2026-07 rotation made that concrete: the signing secret and
the embedded keys are edited in different places at different times, and nothing
compared them.

This closes the loop by verifying the produced signature against the public keys
that ship to users, read straight out of install.sh rather than restated here —
a copy in this file could drift from the installer and would prove nothing about
what a user actually runs. Any populated slot may verify (rotation trusts two
keys at once); the check fails only when NO embedded key accepts the signature,
which is exactly the condition that would strand every consumer.

Exit: 0 verified, 1 mismatch or malformed input.
