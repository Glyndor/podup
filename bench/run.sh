# Fair compose-tool benchmark runner.
#
# Drives each tool through the same scenario suite, the same number of times,
# on the same machine, against digest-pinned, pre-pulled images. Each timed run
# goes through bench/timeit, so every row records wall-clock, peak resident
# memory and CPU time of the orchestrator process; the statistics (median / p95 /
# stdev) are computed by aggregate.py, never here.
#
# Fairness is the whole point: identical compose inputs, identical lifecycle,
# warm-up iterations discarded, every scenario reported, the same op flags for
# every tool. Same-engine tools (podup, podman-compose) drive Podman and are a
# pure tool comparison; docker-compose drives dockerd and is only run when a
# Docker daemon is present, always labelled as an end-to-end stack comparison.
#
# Note on the memory/CPU columns: they are the resource use of the tool process
# and the processes it directly spawns and waits on (getrusage). podup is a thin
# client to the long-running Podman service, so engine-side work is not charged
# to it; podman-compose shells out to the `podman` binary per call, whose work it
# waits on and is charged for. The columns therefore measure client-side cost per
# command, what running the tool costs on your machine, not engine work.
#
# Usage: bench/run.sh [--iters N] [--warmup W] [--cores CPUSET] [--smoke]
