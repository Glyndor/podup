"""Aggregate the raw benchmark rows into honest statistics.

Reads results/raw.csv (written by run.sh), discards warm-up rows and any row
whose command failed (rc != 0), and reports median / p95 / stdev / n per
(tool, scenario, op) for three metrics: wall-clock seconds, peak resident memory
(max RSS), and CPU time. Emits results/report.md and results/summary.json.

No number is invented here: every statistic is computed from the measured rows,
and a losing result is printed exactly like a winning one.
