Version self-test regression for issue #1356, PowerShell side.

Mirrors the bash test in version-self-test.sh:
  1. A stub that reports the resolved tag with v prefix passes the
     self-test.
  2. A stub that reports the resolved tag without v prefix also passes.
  3. A stub that reports an older tag is rejected.
  4. A stub that reports a -dev suffix is rejected (the rollback case:
     a partial token would let `3.7.0-dev` slip past `3.7.0`).
  5. A stub that reports garbage is rejected.
  6. A stub that exits non-zero on --version is rejected.
  7. A staged file that does not exist is rejected.
  8. On any failed self-test the staged file is removed.

The actual Test-StagedVersion function lives in install.ps1; this
script extracts it via AST and loads it in this scope so the regression
runs against the real code, not a copy. (The bash test uses
`sed + source`, which PowerShell cannot mirror directly; AST parsing
is the equivalent and stays robust to surrounding code.)

Test-StagedVersion calls the top-level `Fail` helper on a mismatch.
`Fail` does `exit 1` and that would terminate the whole test process.
`Invoke-Expression` binds the extracted function to the test's scope,
so its reference to `Fail` resolves to a test-local override that
throws - the test catches the throw and reports a clean refusal.
