//! `docs/commands.md` must document every flag the CLI actually accepts.
//!
//! The command reference was written per command by hand and drifted every time
//! a flag landed — #1084 counted fourteen commands with missing flags and one
//! precedence rule that was simply false. Fixing the text once only resets the
//! clock; this test is what stops it recurring, by diffing `--help` against the
//! document rather than trusting either.
//!
//! It asserts one direction only: every flag clap exposes appears in the docs.
//! The reverse (documented flags that no longer exist) is a different failure
//! and a different fix, and folding both into one assertion would make the
//! message ambiguous.
//!
//! The match is scoped to the command's own `###` section. Searching the whole
//! document — which this did until #1132 — means a flag documented anywhere
//! satisfies every command, so eight flags sat undocumented in their own tables
//! while the test stayed green. Scoping it is also the honest reading of what
//! the test claims to check: that a reader looking up `create` finds `--pull`
//! under `create`, not somewhere else entirely.
//!
//! It still checks names, never descriptions. A row can say the opposite of
//! what the code does and this will not notice — `exec`'s pseudo-TTY shipped
//! next to "podup never allocates one" (#1079), and `commit --pause` documented
//! a default of off while the code defaults it on (#1132).
