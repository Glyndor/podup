//! podup does not decide the machine's update policy.
//!
//! `unattended-upgrades` is a hard `Depends`, so podup can be sure the package
//! is installed. Whether it *runs* is a different file:
//! `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades`, which switches automatic upgrades on
//! for every package on the machine rather than for Glyndor's. That is the
//! operator's call, or a fleet manager's. A container runtime is not the thing
//! that should make it, and #1593 settled it that way: leave the one uncovered
//! row (a Debian where somebody registered the archive by hand and ran
//! `apt install podup`) rather than close it from a `postinst`.
//!
//! The consequence is that the packaging guide owes the reader a sentence, because the
//! dependency looks like it delivers the outcome and does not. Both halves of
//! that live in prose, and prose stops being true without anything failing.
//! These are the gate.
