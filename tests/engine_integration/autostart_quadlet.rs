//! Quadlet-mode autostart against real Podman **and real systemd `--user`**.
//!
//! The install/uninstall/rebuild flow shipped covered by unit tests only — a
//! fake `SystemCtl` plus the pure renderer tests — so nothing exercised the part
//! that actually breaks: units written to the systemd directory, generated,
//! started, and the containers coming up. #1091 is what that gap costs. Its bug
//! (a relative `EnvironmentFile=` resolving against the unit directory once
//! installed) is invisible to every renderer test, because the rendered text was
//! exactly what the test expected — it only fails when systemd reads it.
//!
//! **These tests touch the caller's real systemd.** `systemd --user` reads
//! `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` from the manager process, set at login, so a test process
//! cannot redirect it the way the unit tests do: the units really are written to
//! `~/.config/containers/systemd/` and really are started. Two consequences,
//! both load-bearing:
//!
//! * every test uses a per-process project name, so a run cannot collide with
//!   another run, with the developer's own stacks, or with a sibling test;
//! * cleanup runs from `Drop`, so a panic mid-test cannot leave an enabled unit
//!   behind. That is not tidiness — a leaked quadlet unit starts its container
//!   on the user's next boot.
//!
//! They skip when Podman or `systemd --user` is unreachable, which is every
//! non-Linux runner and the main CI job; the nested-virt lane is where they run.
