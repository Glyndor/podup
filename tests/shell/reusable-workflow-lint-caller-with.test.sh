#
# Behaviour tests for the caller's `with:` defaults check in
# .github/workflows/reusable-workflow-lint.yml. The caller-if assertion
# (#1731) refuses a job-level `if:` that can skip a required check.
# This one refuses a job-level `with:` value that differs from the
# reusable's declared `inputs.X.default`. Same outcome through a
# different lever: the ruleset requires the check NAME, but the
# underlying job runs differently when the input value is not the
# one the ruleset was configured against. A pull request to
# ci.yml:coverage-threshold: 76 -> 0, ci.yml:msrv: 1.85 -> '',
# ci.yml:extra-test-os: '["macos-latest", ...]' -> '[]', or
# ci.yml:doc-warnings: true -> false would all keep `rust / Coverage`,
# `rust / MSRV`, `rust / MSRV (1.85)`, `rust / Extra platforms`,
# `rust / Doc warnings` as the names the ruleset matches and silently
# lower or remove the gate. The lint catches each.
#
# The rule is symmetric to caller-if: same named set of required checks,
# same static map, same fixture shape. The comparison is not against
# the ruleset (the ruleset sees check names, not inputs) but against
# the reusable's declared `inputs.X.default`. The reusable is the
# place where the value the ruleset assumes is canonicalised: a
# change to the default is reviewed on the reusable's diff, where the
# ruleset's check name stays stable.
#
# `if:` lines INSIDE a reusable are skipped the same way caller-if
# skips them. The same `reusable-*` basename filter applies. This
# step is wholly in the non-reusable scan path.
#
# Each step's `run:` body is extracted from the workflow and executed
# as it ships, in a temporary tree shaped like a repository. Every
# refusal asserts WHICH message fired. Each refusal is paired with a
# same-shape acceptance so the rule is precise.
#
# Requires: python3 with PyYAML (the step under test imports it).
# The fixtures below carry literal `${{ ... }}` expressions: the
# assertion under test reads those characters, so they must reach
# the file unexpanded. Single quotes are the point, not an oversight.
