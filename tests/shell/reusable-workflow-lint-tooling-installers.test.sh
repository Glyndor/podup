# Behaviour tests for the broadened installer patterns in the
# tooling-isolation step of reusable-workflow-lint.yml. The step
# refuses a job that holds a secret while installing third-party
# tooling. The original list of installers covered `cargo install`,
# `go install`, `gem install`, `npm install -g`/`npm i -g`, and
# `pip install` (with --require-hashes exempted). That list matched
# strings, not the property those strings all share: the install
# reaches code that lives outside this organisation. A pull request
# can dodge the string with a synonym the lint never heard of, and
# the property it was supposed to gate still fires. The release signing
# job is the canonical example: it holds the Ed25519 release key in
# `GLYNDOR_RELEASE_ED25519_KEY` and runs `pip install --quiet
# --require-hashes -r .github/scripts/sign-requirements.txt`, which
# executes the cryptography package's native build script. Hashed,
# so it is exempt; the cryptography build script runs either way.
#
# This file asserts the FIX: the property-based pattern list now
# covers more synonyms and a behavioural test confirms each. Every
# negative fixture would, on the unfixed list, fall through to the
# `cargo install`-textual gap. Every positive fixture matches the
# existing exemption so existing call sites stay green.
#
# Also documented here for the next person to read: the number of
# build scripts the release target executes is 14. The original
# issue cited 33: that is the whole lockfile graph with dev-deps and
# every other platform included. Filtered to
# `cargo metadata --filter-platform x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` it is
# 14 (confirmed against 15 directories in `target/release/build/`,
# one of which is the podup crate's own build script, the other 14
# are deps). An acceptance built on 33 would exempt crates the
# release never builds; 14 is the number that states the property.
#
# Each step's `run:` body is extracted from the workflow and executed
# as it ships, in a temporary tree shaped like a repository. Every
# refusal is paired with a same-shape acceptance so the rule is
# precise.
#
# Requires: python3 with PyYAML (the tooling-isolation step imports
# it), cargo (the build-script-count assertion at the bottom). The
# fixtures below carry literal `${{ secrets.X }}` expressions: the
# assertion under test reads those characters, so they must reach
# the file unexpanded. Single quotes are the point, not an oversight.
