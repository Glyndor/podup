# Rootless autostart

`podup autostart` keeps a compose stack running across reboots, entirely
**rootless and user-scope**: it writes only under `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}`
and drives everything through `systemctl --user`. Nothing touches `/etc`, the
system systemd, or root. The stack runs as an unprivileged user, and systemd
brings it up at boot.

## Prerequisite: lingering

A user's systemd manager normally exists only while that user has a session, and
`/run/user/<uid>` is created at login and torn down at logout. A service account
never logs in, so without lingering there is no user manager at boot and the stack
never starts. Enable it once, as root:

```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger appuser
loginctl show-user appuser --property=Linger   # → Linger=yes
```

Lingering starts the user manager at boot and creates `/run/user/<uid>` up front,
independent of any login. `podup autostart install` warns if lingering is off,
because the unit it writes will not start at boot until you enable it.

## Picking a mode

`--mode` selects the backend. All three are rootless and user-scope; they differ
in who owns the containers, and in whether the boot path reconciles.

| Mode | What it installs | Choose it when |
|---|---|---|
| `service` (default) | One `Type=oneshot` unit that runs `podup up -d --no-build --pull never` at boot and `podup stop` on shutdown. | You want the whole stack managed as a unit, the simplest option: one thing to enable, one to remove. |
| `quadlet` | One native Podman Quadlet unit per service (`.container`/`.build`/`.volume`/`.network`), which systemd owns directly. Images are built at install (and on `autostart rebuild`), not at boot. | You want per-container supervision: systemd restarts, ordering and status for each service independently. |
| `start` | One `Type=oneshot` unit whose `ExecStart` is `podman start`. Single-service projects only. | You want the boot to resume the container that already exists, with nothing else on the path. |

### Reconcile or restore

This is the axis that actually separates them, and it is worth being explicit
because two of the three sit on the same side of it.

`service` and `quadlet` both make the world match the file at boot. Service mode
keeps the compose front-end (`.env`, interpolation, profiles) on the runtime path:
systemd starts `podup`, and `podup` reads the compose file. It still recreates a
container whose compose definition changed (its `podup.config-hash` label no
longer matches), but only from images already on disk: the unit never builds or
pulls a service image, so a missing one fails it where `systemctl --user status` and the
journal show it, instead of being repaired silently on an unattended machine.
Quadlet mode renders the stack to
systemd units once, at install time, and hands them over, after which systemd
runs the containers with no `podup` process in the loop, though Podman still
reconciles each `.container` against its unit.

`start` does neither. Podman is daemonless and its store survives a reboot, so
every setting was baked into the container definition when it was created.
`podman start` restores the lot with no compose file, no `.env`, no registry and
no build on the path.

The failure semantics are the reason to choose it rather than a side effect. A
container missing at boot means a deploy went wrong, and booting cannot fix a
broken deploy: `start` fails loudly in the journal, and so does `service` mode
when the image is gone. What `service` mode still does at boot, and `start` does
not, is recreate a container whose compose definition changed. Deploy reconciles;
boot restores.

### What `start` costs

**Single-service projects only.** `podman start` waits for nothing, so a project
with `depends_on` (and especially `condition: service_healthy`) needs ordering
between units, which is exactly what quadlet mode derives from the compose file.
Rather than reimplement that, `start` refuses a project with more than one service,
or one scaled past a single replica, and the error names the mode to use instead.

**Drift is caught at install, not at boot.** If `compose.yaml` changes after the
container was created, a boot would resume the old configuration. `podup` compares
the container's `podup.config-hash` label against what the file renders and refuses
to install over a mismatch, or over a container that does not exist yet.

That check runs when you install, because there is no `podup` at boot to run it,
which is the point of the mode, and therefore also its limit. Editing the compose
file after installing leaves the unit starting the old container silently. Run
`podup up -d` after any change to the file, exactly as you would to deploy it.

The three cannot coexist for one project: each install refuses if another is
present, since they would all bring the same stack up at boot. Re-installing
the same mode rewrites the unit in place (that is the documented upgrade
path); switching modes requires `podup autostart uninstall` first, the same
command that removes the update-timer pair left behind by a service-mode
install with `--auto-update`.

## Commands

```bash
podup autostart install                  # service mode (default)
podup autostart install --mode quadlet   # quadlet mode
podup autostart install --no-start       # write the unit(s) but don't start yet
podup autostart install --dry-run        # print what would be written/run, change nothing
podup autostart install --mode service --auto-update daily   # service mode + a sibling timer

podup autostart status                   # this project's unit and session state
podup autostart uninstall                # remove whichever mode is installed
podup autostart uninstall --purge        # also tear the stack down and drop its volumes

podup autostart rebuild                   # quadlet only: rebuild every built image + restart
podup autostart rebuild web               # rebuild just one service
```

## Auto-update

`x-podman-autoupdate` on a service asks Podman's auto-update to keep the
image fresh. The three autostart modes pick a different executor, and which
executor runs where is the part that matters:

| Mode | Executor | How it is installed |
|---|---|---|
| `quadlet` | `podman-auto-update.timer` (ships with Podman) | nothing to do: Quadlet sets `AutoUpdate=<value>` on each `.container` and the bundled timer fires it. |
| `service` | a per-project `<unit>-update.timer` (`hourly`/`daily`/`weekly`) | `podup autostart install --mode service --auto-update <hourly\|daily\|weekly>`. Adds `<unit>-update.service` (oneshot that runs plain `podup up -d`, which builds and pulls missing images and re-checks the registry for `x-podman-autoupdate: registry` services that have no `build:`) and the timer that fires it; uninstall removes both. |
| `start` | none | the boot path runs `podman start`, not `podup up`. `--auto-update` is rejected with `--mode start`. |

For stacks that are not under autostart at all (no `podup autostart
install` was run), the schedule is the same `podup up -d` line as the
service-mode timer, dropped in cron:

```
0 3 * * *  cd /srv/app && podup up -d
```

Without `--auto-update`, the install path produces exactly what it did before
the feature existed. The timer pair only appears when the flag is given, and
`autostart uninstall` removes all three units together.

`uninstall` detects which mode is installed and removes that one; you never pass
`--mode` to it. `rebuild` applies to quadlet mode: a Quadlet `.build` unit is
`Type=oneshot`, so an image only rebuilds when its build service is restarted, and
the container is then restarted to pick it up. Service mode has no `rebuild`; it
builds at deploy time, whenever you run `podup up`.

Quadlet mode builds at install, never at boot or on container restart. The
`.container` unit points its `Image=` at the build's tag with `Pull=never`, so
Quadlet adds no dependency on the build service: an unattended reboot starts
the cached image, the same way service mode does. A stack installed by an
older `podup` (which still pointed the container at `<stem>.build` and let
Quadlet re-run the build every start) keeps that behaviour until
`podup autostart install --mode quadlet` is run again; `rebuild` is the
explicit way to build a fresh image in between.

### Upgrading an existing service-mode install

A unit keeps the `ExecStart` it was written with. Units written by 5.10.5 or earlier
run `podup up -d` at boot, which builds or pulls a missing image. After upgrading
`podup`, run `podup autostart install` again with the flags you used the first
time: it overwrites the unit in place and leaves it enabled, so the unit picks up
`up -d --no-build --pull never`. `podup autostart install --dry-run` prints the
unit it would write.

## Why `--user` and `default.target`

The unit is a `--user` unit wired into `default.target`, not the system
`multi-user.target`. `multi-user.target` is a system-manager concept and is inert
in the user instance, so ordering against it would imply a boot gate that never
fires. The same is true of `network-online.target`, which is why neither mode
names it.

Waiting for the network still has to happen somewhere, and Podman ships the piece
that makes it possible from a user unit:
`podman-user-wait-network-online.service`, a `Type=oneshot` unit that polls
`systemctl is-active network-online.target` until the system target comes up.
Both modes order against that shim. Quadlet mode gets it from Podman's generator
(`man podman-systemd.unit`, under *Implicit network dependencies*), which adds
`Wants=` and `After=` to every `.container` unit it converts. Service mode writes
its final unit itself, so `podup` puts the same two lines in directly:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=podup <project>
Wants=podman-user-wait-network-online.service
After=podman-user-wait-network-online.service
```

The wait earns its place in service mode more than it does under Quadlet, not
less. Quadlet's `ExecStart` starts a container; this one runs `podup up`, and
under rootless Podman pasta builds the container network at start time.

Measured 2026-08-30: the shim first ships in Podman 5.3.0, while `podup`'s floor
is 5.0. On 5.0 through 5.2 systemd finds no such unit, drops the `Wants=` and
`After=` with `LoadState=not-found`, and starts the unit clean with
`Result=success` and nothing in the journal. Nothing regresses on those versions;
they simply get no ordering, which is what they had.

That silence is the problem with leaving it there. The unit file *reads* as
though it waits for the network, and on those versions it does not, with nothing
anywhere to say so. `podup autostart status` therefore asks:

```
network wait: podman-user-wait-network-online.service is loaded
```

or, when it is not:

```
network wait: podman-user-wait-network-online.service is not loadable, so the
              unit's network ordering is dropped silently (Podman ships it from 5.3.0)
```

Note for anyone changing that check: `systemctl show <unit> -p LoadState` exits
**0 whether or not the unit exists**, and reports the answer only in the
`LoadState=` string. That is the opposite of `is-active` and `is-enabled`, which
both exit 4 for an unknown unit. A guard written against the exit code reports
the shim as present in exactly the case it is missing.

## Running `systemctl --user` for a login-less account

An isolated service account has no login shell, so you cannot open a session for
it: `su - appuser` and `machinectl shell appuser@` both bounce, because they try
to launch a login shell that does not exist. With no session there is no D-Bus
session bus, and `systemctl --user` without a bus fails:

```
$ systemctl --user is-system-running
Failed to connect to user scope bus via local transport:
$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS and $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR not defined
```

Lingering already created the runtime directory, so the fix is to point
`systemctl` at it explicitly:

```bash
uid=$(id -u appuser)
ls -d /run/user/$uid          # exists thanks to lingering

sudo -u appuser env XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$uid \
     podup autostart install --mode quadlet
```

Every `systemctl --user` / `podup autostart` invocation for that account needs
`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/<uid>` in its environment. The same applies over SSH:
a non-login SSH command has no runtime dir set, so export it before running
`podup autostart`.

## One-time rootless setup

For a dedicated service account the account itself needs the usual rootless
Podman groundwork, done once:

- **Subordinate UID/GID ranges.** Rootless Podman maps container users into the
  host user's subordinate ranges. Ensure the account has entries in
  `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` (e.g. `appuser:100000:65536`).
- **`podman system migrate` as the user.** Run it **as the account**, never via
  `sudo` as root, so the migration writes the account's own storage config rather
  than root's:

  ```bash
  sudo -u appuser env XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u appuser) \
       podman system migrate
  ```

- **The Podman API socket.** `podman` is daemonless and needs no socket, so a
  fresh account can run `podman` fine and still have every `podup` command fail
  with a connection error. podup speaks the libpod API, so the socket has to be
  listening:

  ```bash
  sudo -u appuser env XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u appuser) \
       systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket
  ```

  The `env XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=…` is the same requirement as above and for the same
  reason: an account with no login shell has no user session, so `systemctl
  --user` cannot find the manager without being told where it lives.

After that, `podup autostart install` writes the unit(s), reloads the user
manager, and starts the stack; a reboot brings it back on its own.
