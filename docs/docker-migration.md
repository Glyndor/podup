# Migrating from Docker Compose to podup

Point podup at an existing `docker-compose.yml` and run it — no rewrite, no new
file format. The short answer is: **most files work without any changes**.

```sh
cd my-project          # the directory holding docker-compose.yml
podup up
```

podup reads the same `compose.yaml` / `docker-compose.yml` files docker-compose
does and runs them on rootless Podman. The rest of this guide is the full
picture: what works unchanged, what behaves differently under Podman, what is
accepted but has no effect, and what is not yet supported.

## Works out of the box

Every core Compose spec key is supported:

| Category | Keys |
|---|---|
| Images / build | `image`, `build` (context, dockerfile, args, target, cache_from, cache_to, secrets, labels, network) |
| Execution | `command`, `entrypoint`, `working_dir`, `user`, `platform`, `tty`, `stdin_open` |
| Environment | `environment`, `env_file` (dotenv format), variable substitution (`${VAR:-default}`) |
| Networking | `ports`, `expose`, `networks`, `network_mode`, `hostname`, `domainname`, `dns`, `dns_search`, `extra_hosts` |
| Volumes | `volumes` (bind, named, tmpfs, npipe), `tmpfs`, `volumes_from` |
| Secrets / configs | `secrets`, `configs` (file, inline content, environment source, and `external: true` Podman-native secrets) |
| Dependencies | `depends_on` (with `condition:` — `service_started`, `service_healthy`, `service_completed_successfully`) |
| Health checks | `healthcheck` (test, interval, timeout, retries, start_period, disable) |
| Lifecycle hooks | `post_start`, `pre_stop` |
| Restart policies | `restart`, `deploy.restart_policy` (`condition`, `max_attempts`) |
| Replicas / scale | `deploy.replicas`, `scale:` |
| Resource limits | `deploy.resources`, `mem_limit`, `cpus`, `cpu_shares`, `cpu_quota`, `pids_limit`, `ulimits`, `blkio_config` |
| Devices | `devices`, `device_cgroup_rules` |
| GPU | `deploy.resources.reservations.devices`, `gpus:` — see the note below |
| Security | `cap_add`, `cap_drop`, `security_opt`, `read_only`, `privileged`, `userns_mode` |
| Namespaces | `pid`, `ipc`, `uts`, `cgroup`, `shm_size` |
| Metadata | `labels`, `annotations`, `container_name`, `profiles` |
| Logging | `logging` (driver + options) |
| Compose features | `extends`, `include`, YAML anchors, x-extensions, `develop.watch` |

### GPU reservations are host-dependent

`deploy.resources.reservations.devices` and the `gpus:` shorthand are honored,
but only for **NVIDIA** GPUs, and only when the host exposes them through CDI
(the NVIDIA Container Toolkit must be installed and the CDI spec generated).
Reservations for other drivers or capabilities are warned about and skipped.
This is the common case Podman supports natively — but it depends on the host's
GPU driver and CDI setup, not on podup alone.

### External secrets and configs

A secret or config declared `external: true` is mounted from an existing
Podman secret rather than from a value in the project tree — the recommended
pattern for production credentials, since the secret material never appears in
the compose file or its history. (Inline `content:`/`environment:` sources are
also injected as Podman-native secrets, not host bind-mounts, but their value
still lives in the compose file.) Create the secret before running, exactly as
you would with `docker secret`:

```sh
printf '%s' "$DB_PASSWORD" | podman secret create db_password -
```

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:16
    secrets:
      - db_password
secrets:
  db_password:
    external: true
```

The secret appears at `/run/secrets/db_password` (configs use the long-form
`target:` path). If the named Podman secret does not exist, `podup up` fails
fast rather than starting a container without it. Use a top-level `name:` when
the Podman secret is named differently from the compose reference.

## Behaves differently under rootless Podman

These are Podman behaviours, not podup limitations — they apply equally to any
Podman-based tool. Each one is something to expect, with the workaround.

### `network_mode: bridge`

| | |
|---|---|
| **What to expect** | docker-compose attaches the container to Docker's predefined shared `bridge` network. Podman reads `--network bridge` as "create a fresh, isolated bridge netns", so the container has outbound connectivity but **cannot reach its project siblings** by name or IP. |
| **Workaround** | Remove `network_mode: bridge` and let the container join the project's default network, or declare a shared `networks:` entry the services share. podup emits a warning when it sees `network_mode: bridge`. |

```yaml
# before — siblings unreachable under Podman
services:
  web:
    network_mode: bridge

# after — services share a network and resolve each other by name
services:
  web:
    networks: [app]
  api:
    networks: [app]
networks:
  app: {}
```

### Privileged ports (< 1024)

Rootless containers cannot bind host ports below 1024 unless the kernel allows
it:

```bash
# Allow ports down to 80 (persists; requires root once):
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80

# Or map through a higher port in your compose file:
ports:
  - "8080:80"
```

### UID/GID mapping

Containers run as your host user's UID inside a user namespace. If a container
image writes files with UID 0 (root inside the container), those files appear
owned by your user on the host. Bind-mount permissions reflect your host user's
access.

### Volume SELinux labels

On SELinux-enforcing systems, bind mounts require relabeling. Append `:z`
(shared) or `:Z` (private) to the volume spec:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./data:/app/data:Z
```

### `network_mode: host`

Attaches the container to your user's network namespace, not a privileged host
namespace. Traffic is still limited to your user's capabilities.

### `network_mode: none`

Supported. The container gets a loopback interface only.

### `mac_address:` at the service level

The Compose spec deprecated the top-level `mac_address` field in favour of
per-network configuration. podup still honours it (for backward compatibility)
and applies it to the primary network, but logs a deprecation warning. Move it
under `networks:` to silence the warning:

```yaml
# before
services:
  web:
    mac_address: "02:42:ac:11:00:02"

# after
services:
  web:
    networks:
      default:
        mac_address: "02:42:ac:11:00:02"
```

## Accepted but has no effect

These fields parse cleanly so existing compose files validate, but podup cannot
translate them on single-host rootless Podman. **podup emits a warning for each
one it finds**, so nothing is dropped silently. The list below is a set of
**examples, not exhaustive** — when in doubt, run `podup up` and read the
warnings (see [Seeing the warnings](#seeing-the-warnings)).

### Swarm / cluster orchestration

| Field | What it does in Swarm |
|---|---|
| `deploy.mode: global` | Run one replica per cluster node |
| `deploy.placement` | Constrain which nodes a service runs on |
| `deploy.update_config` | Rolling-update parallelism, delay, failure action |
| `deploy.rollback_config` | Automatic rollback behaviour |
| `deploy.endpoint_mode` | VIP vs DNS round-robin load balancing |
| `deploy.restart_policy.delay` / `.window` | No first-class Podman restart delay or attempt-counting window (`condition` and `max_attempts` *are* honored) |
| port long-form `mode:` (`ingress` / `host`) | Swarm ingress routing |

### BuildKit / buildx-only build options

`build.privileged`, `build.ssh`, `build.ulimits`, `build.isolation`,
`build.entitlements`, `build.provenance`, `build.sbom` — these have no libpod
build-API equivalent and are ignored.

### Windows / Hyper-V-only

`cpu_count`, `cpu_percent`, `credential_spec`, `isolation` — no rootless Podman
equivalent.

### Other parsed-but-ignored fields

| Field | Why it has no effect |
|---|---|
| `attach` | podup follows its own attach/detach logic for `up` log streaming |
| `use_api_socket` | no podup equivalent |
| `provider:` / top-level `models:` | podup runs no model runner; the service/model is not honored (see [Not yet supported](#not-yet-supported)) |
| volume long-form `driver_config` | not forwarded to Podman |
| `networks.*.enable_ipv4` | Podman networks enable IPv4 by default and expose no toggle |
| `networks.*.ipam.config[].aux_addresses` | not supported by Podman |
| service `networks.*.gw_priority` | not supported by Podman |
| `secrets`/`configs` `driver` / `template_driver` (on non-`external` defs) | external secret-store plugins (Vault, AWS SM, …) podup does not invoke; the secret/config is not staged |

## Not yet supported

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| `env_file.format` values other than `dotenv` | A **warning** is emitted (`format is not honored; podup always parses env files as dotenv`); the file is still read as dotenv |
| `provider:` / model-runner services (`provider`, top-level `models`) | Modeled and parsed, but **not honored** — a not-honored warning is emitted (these are no rootless-Podman equivalent, *not* "unknown key" errors) |
| Container naming | A single-replica service is named `<project>-<service>` (e.g. `myapp-web`); docker-compose v2 always appends a `-1` replica index (`myapp-web-1`). Scaled replicas (>1) do get the `-N` suffix. Scripts that reference containers by exact name should account for this. |
| Real-hardware smoke tests on macOS and Windows | Pending ([#48](https://github.com/Glyndor/podup/issues/48)); code paths exist but are untested on physical hardware |

## Nothing is dropped silently

podup follows the Compose spec's forward-compatibility rule — an unknown key is
never a hard error, so `x-*` extensions and newer compose fields keep parsing.
But anything podup cannot translate is **reported**, never silently ignored, so
a typo or an unmapped feature can't hide. At parse time podup warns about:

- unknown keys at the top level and inside every modeled object (services and
  their `healthcheck`, `deploy`, `develop.watch`; top-level `networks`,
  `networks.*.ipam`, and `volumes`) — usually a typo such as `enviroment:`;
- modeled fields it cannot honor on rootless Podman — the
  [accepted-but-has-no-effect](#accepted-but-has-no-effect) fields above.

This is what lets a compose file written for a newer Docker or Podman release
run under podup: unsupported additions surface as warnings instead of vanishing.

`extra_hosts` is accepted in both the list (`["host:ip"]`) and mapping
(`{host: ip}`) forms.

### Seeing the warnings

The `podup` CLI prints these warnings automatically. Run with
`RUST_LOG=podup=debug` to also see network creation and container lifecycle
events. See the [`RUST_LOG` reference in `commands.md`](commands.md#environment)
for the full level table.

If you embed podup as a **library**, `parse_file` itself stays quiet — call
`podup::collect_diagnostics` on the parsed file to obtain the same warnings and
surface them to your users.

## File references and path confinement

Compose files are **trusted input**, like a Makefile. Path-valued keys that the
spec resolves relative to the compose file — `extends.file`, `env_file`,
`label_file`, and `include` — may use `../` to reach files outside the project
directory, matching docker-compose. Absolute paths are accepted too (an
absolute `include:` is used as given, as in docker-compose). This is an
intentional divergence from a fully sandboxed parser: do not feed podup a
compose file from an untrusted source any more than you would `make -f` an
untrusted Makefile.

## Quick compatibility checklist

Before running `podup up` on an existing compose file:

- [ ] Replace `network_mode: bridge` with a shared `networks:` entry if services need to reach each other.
- [ ] Remove or remap any host ports below 1024 if running fully rootless.
- [ ] Add `:Z` to bind mounts on SELinux hosts if containers cannot write to them.
- [ ] Check for `mac_address:` at the service level — move to `networks:` to silence the warning.
- [ ] Check for Swarm-only `deploy.*` fields — they are harmless but can be cleaned up.
- [ ] Verify `env_file` uses dotenv format (key=value lines, `#` comments).
- [ ] For GPUs, confirm the host has an NVIDIA driver + CDI configured.
